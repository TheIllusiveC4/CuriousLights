Curious Lights is a mod that acts as a simple compatibility bridge between [Curios API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios)
and dynamic light mods. With this mod, items in curios slots will inherit the dynamic lighting behavior defined by the
dynamic lighting mod. As an example, if a held torch would provide dynamic lighting, then installing this mod will cause
torches placed in curios slots to also provide dynamic lighting.

**Please note: This mod does NOT add any content or slots on its own. In order to gain more slots or assign items into
slots, users will need to either add a mod that adds that kind of content or add it themselves through the Curios
API configuration and datapacks [as shown in this guide](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).**

**Compatible Mods**
- [Dynamic Lights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-lights)
- [Lucent](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lucent)
- [Dynamic Lights Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamiclights-reforged)

Note: This mod's sidedness depends on the dynamic lighting mod used. For example, if using Lucent then this mod is
client-side only because Lucent is client-side only. On the other hand, if using Dynamic Lights then this mod is
required on both client and server because Dynamic Lights is required on both as well.
